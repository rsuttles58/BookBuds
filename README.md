# BookBuds

BookBuds is a friend-finding application that allows book enthusiasts to find someone to share a reading adventure with.  Book Clubs can often be a drag due to people not reading the book, you not having interest in the same genres as other members, lack of connection with the group, etc etc.  BookBuds pairs you with one other person who shares similar reading interests as you in hopes of helping you and a friend share in a group novel together.

## Technical Application Specs

This project utilizes javascript, express, path, ajax, and node.js to render the BookBuds website.  This project uses an MVC model approach. Routing is funnelled internally through two main HTML routes and a number of API routes for getting and posting new data.  For the purposes of this demo, data is stored in an object but could easily be transitioned to mysql or another database application for data storage.
